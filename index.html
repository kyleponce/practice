		<h1>This is Kyle Ponce's Practive Webpage</h1>
			<p> This is a <i>practice paragraph</i> about nothing - please ignore. </p>
			<p> My name is </br>
			Kyle and I am </br>
			Just now learning </br>
			How to code </p>
			<p> And now I will demonstrate how to make a break in the code. You will know because there will be a bar directly below this bit of text here </p>
			<hr />
			<p>Voila! Amazing, right?</p>
		<h2>This is a subheader demonstrating the H2 tag</h2>
			<p>The <b>H2</b> tag makes a slightly <sub>smaller</sub> heading from what I understand</p>
			<p>Now that you have seen my impressive skills with H2 tags, now I will show off the use of <q>strong</q> and <q>emphasis!</q>
			<p><strong>This bit of text is strong, cant you tell?</strong><em>Amd this bit of text is emphasized.</em></p>
		<h2>Abbreviation!</h2>
			<p>Now I don't quite get the use of the abbreciation Markup, but allow me to demonstrate!</p>
			<p><abbr title="Fuck you">Hover</abbr> Hover over the word Hover and you should find a yellow box that gives you information</p>
			<address>
				<p><s>In case you have any problems with this site you can go fuck yourself,</s> <a href="mailto:kyleponce@gmail.com">or email me here</a></p>

		<h3>Please allow me to demonstrate how lists work, OK?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Step One: </b>Fuck off</li>
				<li><b>Step Two: </b>Go fuck yourself</li>
				<li><b>Step Three: </b>There is no step three, sorry bout it</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And now...an unordered list</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dead man's finger</li>
				<li>Witches tooth</li>
				<li>A mummy's dressings</li>
			</ul>
			<dl>
				<dt>Dead man's finger</dt>
				<dd>A finger removed from a newly deceased man</dd>
				<dt>Witches tooth</dt>
				<dd>The bony protuberance that erupted from a witche's dirty mouth. Most often a rear molar</dd>
